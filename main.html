                <p id="intro_paragraph">Hi, my name is Troy Paulsson. I currently work as a Business Systems Analyst, working with systems such as Salesforce, Netsuite and Workato.
                    Throughout my education and career, programming has always been present in one form or another, and my interest in the topic continued to grow
                    until I could no longer ignore it. The ability to build things fascinates me, and I have so many ideas of things I want to create and topics to explore. Once I keyed in on this,
                    it became clear that I wanted to learn software development, and I began teaching myself through various courses and means. This Portfolio is the product of one such course, 
                    and it will work to help share my other projects as well. Please enjoy and feel free to reach out!
